# Implementation of Algorithm Described in ICML 2024 Spotlight Paper

Reviwers asked for an implementation of the algorithm we described convergence for in the ICML 2024 spotlight paper. We demonstrated convergene for our algorithm in a simulted OpenAI gym setup. The code used the Antbullet environment (https://huggingface.co/sb3/tqc-AntBulletEnv-v0). Our implementation demonstrated convegergence while using a neural network for both the actor and the critic. This lines up well with the theoretical results established in the paper.
